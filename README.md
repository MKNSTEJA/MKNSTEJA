# Hey there, I'm Teja! 👋

🎯 Coding and my life are just me endlessly trying to fix my past mistakes (which are temporary, questionable, and bound to break again! 💣💻). Except one has a debugger and the other just has regret!

## About Me

Hey! I'm **Teja**, currently pursuing a bachelor's in Mechatronics at **RPTU Kaiserslautern** and coding course at **42 Heilbronn**. Combining mechatronics and programming feels like possessing a superpower! ⚡🤖

I strive for the simplest and most straightforward approach in my code (most of the times atleast) to improve readability and understanding. Despite technically doing two degrees at once, I consider my progress in the 42 core curriculum impressive because of my ability to learn anything very quickly. 🚀

My main expertise lies in C programming, Shell scripting, Bash, Git, and Python.
Soon I will be expanding my expertise in C++, C#, Networking, Graphics and Game development, Web development and Maching Learning with the help of Core curriculum and Mastery course at **42 Heilbronn**.
